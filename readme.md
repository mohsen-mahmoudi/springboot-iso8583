Spring Boot ISO 8583

A Java-based implementation of the ISO 8583 protocol using Spring Boot and JPOS.
Overview

This project provides a foundational framework for building ISO 8583-compliant financial transaction systems. It includes both client and server modules, facilitating the simulation and handling of ISO 8583 messages.

Features

    Spring Boot Integration: Leverages Spring Boot for rapid application development and configuration.

    JPOS Library: Utilizes the JPOS library for ISO 8583 message parsing and construction.

    Modular Structure: Separates client and server functionalities into distinct modules for clarity and maintainability.

    Gradle Build System: Employs Gradle for efficient project build and dependency management.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

    Gradle (or use the provided Gradle wrapper)

Building the Project

To build the entire project, navigate to the root directory and execute:
```
./gradlew build
```
Running the Server

To start the ISO 8583 server:
```
cd iso8583-server-jpos
./gradlew bootRun
```
Running the Client

To start the ISO 8583 client:
```
cd iso8583-client-jpos
./gradlew bootRun
```
Configuration

Both client and server modules can be configured via application.properties or application.yml files located in their respective src/main/resources directories. Key configurations include:

Server Port: Define the port on which the server listens for incoming connections.

Client Target Host and Port: Specify the server's host and port that the client will connect to.

Usage

Once both the client and server are running:

The client constructs an ISO 8583 message using JPOS and sends it to the server.

The server receives the message, parses it, and processes it accordingly.

The server may send a response back to the client based on the message type and processing result.

This setup is ideal for testing ISO 8583 message flows and can be extended for more complex transaction scenarios.
